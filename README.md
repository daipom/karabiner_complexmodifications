	- Key customazation tool for mac
- About this config
	- Vim customization for Japanese layout(JIS) mac keyboard.
	- While pushing `英数` key, vim VIEW mode is applied.
	- This provides you very smooth editing in all applications.
- How to use
	- Install Karabiner from the above url.
	- Apply this config.
		- `git clone https://github.com/daipom/karabiner_complexmodifications.git ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`
		- Open `Karabiner-Elements Preferences`, and select `Complex modifications` tab.
		- Push `Add rule`, and you can see `myvim while pushing eisu key` setting, then select its `Enable All`.
- Note
	- You can use `right-command` to change to `英数` mode.
		- This may be not useful when you edit Japanese text. I'm looking for a better way about this.
